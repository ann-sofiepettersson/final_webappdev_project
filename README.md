I wanted to make a persona "Moviebox" where you can serch for movie and tv-shows, get the informations you need and save them in personal lists, what you want to see, what you have seen etc.  

Technologies I have used:
-HTML
-CSS
-Bootstrap
-jQuery
-JSON

I have used data from The Movie Database API

I started whith desktop first and then adjusted to mobile. I did the project with parallax scrolling. There is a lott of improvements, 
the content in the list section is showing over the navbar.
